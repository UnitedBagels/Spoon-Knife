I'm considering working on a few different projects. The first few that came to mind are some more common repositories at RPI/RCOS projects, such as QuACS and ShuttleTracker. A more advanced/blessed repository that I'm considering working on is GIMP (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp) since it is largely written in Python. However, it is hosted on GitLab instead of GitHub, which should not make too much of a difference.
